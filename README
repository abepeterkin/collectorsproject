IMPLEMENTED: User accounts, Object uploading

PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED: User profile page

NOT IMPLEMENTED: Searching through objects, a better explanation for how object uploading works

Code Structure:
We use Node.js, and server.js is the main file you should run to start the server.

The public folder contains all of our ejs templates, CSS, images, and front-end Javascript.

The app and config folders contain some important back-end javascript files, such as routes.js (our ajax routes), passport.js (passport user authentication helper functions), and objectdatabase.js (helper functions for querying and inserting objects into the database)

Routes:
GET request to / will load the home page
GET request to /upload will load the object uploading page
POST request to /upload will upload a file containing object data
POST request to /login will log the user in
POST request to /signup will create a user account
GET request to /userprofile will load a userâ€™s profile page (profile pages still in progress)
